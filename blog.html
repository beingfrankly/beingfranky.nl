Before I read the documentation on these attributes, they confused me because they seem so similar, while there are, in fact, some crucial differences between the three. I hope by the end of this post you’ll know when and how to use these three attributes.\n\nBefore I go on and explain the differences, I do want to stress something out which is the first rule of using ARIA: **Don't use ARIA**. This almost sounds like the [first rule of Fight club](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fight_club/quotes/#:~:text=to%20Fight%20Club.-,The%20first%20rule%20of%20Fight%20Club%20is%3A%20you%20do%20not,out%2C%20the%20fight%20is%20over.). I’ll be honest here and say that I found this rather confusing in the beginning. Only after reading about it and understanding the intent behind the rule did it click with me. I think it might have been better to name the first rule like this: **Prefer native HTML over ARIA**. We shouldn’t use ARIA attributes without considering using the semantic HTML element first. I’ll dive deeper into the five rules of using ARIA in a different post since it’s beyond the scope of this topic.\n\n## The aria-label\n\nThe `aria-label` attribute is somewhat similar to the `\u003clabel\u003e` element. It doesn't have some of the advantages that the `\u003clabel\u003e` element has, but its purpose is the same. Giving context, through the [Accessible Name](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.2/), to the element it's associated with.\n\nUnlike the `\u003clabel\u003e` element (which is its own element) the `aria-label` attribute needs to be put on the element itself. It could look like this:\n\n```html\n\u003cbutton aria-label=\"Close\"\u003e\n  \u003csvg\u003e\n    \u003c!-- svg content --\u003e\n  \u003c/svg\u003e\n\u003c/button\u003e\n```\n\nThe `aria-label` attribute takes a string value, which is then used to create the Accessible Name for the `\u003cbutton\u003e` element. The common use case for the `aria-label` attribute is when we’re not able to use the native `\u003clabel\u003e` element, while still providing context for the Accessible Name.\n\n## The aria-labelledby\n\nAlthough the `aria-labelledby` attribute may look similar to `aria-label`, it works quite different. Instead of a string value, it requires the ID of the element we’re referencing.\n\nLet’s say we would want to give meaning to the `\u003cbutton\u003e` through the ID of the `\u003csvg\u003e`element. It would look like this:\n\n```html\n\u003cbutton aria-labelledby=\"close-icon\"\u003e\n  \u003csvg aria-label=\"Close\" id=\"close-icon\" \u003e\n    \u003c!-- svg content --\u003e\n  \u003c/svg\u003e\n\u003c/button\u003e\n```\n\nWe could view `aria-labelledby`, in this regard, that it’s inheriting the context from the `\u003csvg\u003e`. The benefit of this approach is that we gain flexibility on how we give meaning to our `\u003cbutton\u003e`. The bad part of this approach is that the [support isn’t that great](https://a11ysupport.io/tech/aria/aria-labelledby_attribute).\n\nAnother big difference, over the `aria-label`, is that it could also accept a space-separated list of element IDs. This lets us “build” a certain context from different parts of the UI. For now I haven’t found a practical example to go with this.\n\n## The aria-describedby\n\nThe `aria-describedby` attribute is used to add a description for the element it’s used on. I wanted to include this attribute as well next to the `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby` since there’s some confusion on what they mean and when we should use them.\n\n```html\n\u003clabel for=\"password-input\"\u003ePassword\u003c/label\u003e\n\u003cinput id=\"password-input\" type=\"password\" aria-describedby=\"password-input-description\"\u003e\n\u003cspan id=\"password-input-description\"\u003ePassword must contain at least 8 characters\u003cspan\u003e\n```\n\nIn the example I’ve used the `aria-describedby` attribute to give a description to a password input. And because we’ve attached the description to the input field it will be recognized by the screen reader, enabling it to announce the description after the label of the input.\n\n\u003e Voice Over on MacOS would announce something like this: Password, secure edit text. Password must contain at least 8 characters.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- The `aria-label` attribute accepts a string value which provides the **Accessible Name** on the element it’s used on\n- The `aria-labelledby` attribute accepts either a single ID or multiple ID’s which will be used for the **Accessible Name**\n- We should only use the `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` on interactive elements, landmarks or elements that have an explicit\n- When both `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby` attributes are present on the same element, the value of `aria-labelledby` will take priority\n\n### Further reading\n\n- [w3 - Using aria-labelledby to provide a name for user interface controls](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/ARIA16.html)\n- [w3 - Using aria-labelledby to concatenate a label from several text nodes](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/ARIA9)\n- [MDN - Using the aria-labelledby attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-labelledby_attribute)\n- [WAI-ARIA - documentaion on aria-label](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#aria-label)\n- [WAI-ARIA - documentation on aria-labelledby](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#aria-labelledby)\n","postPath":"The differences between the ARIA labeling variants.md","title":"The differences between the ARIA labeling variants"},{"data":{"type":"blog","title":"An accessible input without a visible label","published":true,"published_on":"2021-10-03","tags":["accessibility","aria","labels","css"],"description":"small description on the blog post","keywords":["accessibility","screen reader","labels","css","accessibility tree"],"slug":"accessible-input-without-label","id":"2021w39b1","updatedOn":"2021-10-21T10:29:17.033Z"},"content":"\n# How to have an accessible input while the label isn’t present?\n\nIn another bite-sized post I want to take the time to cover a common UI pattern that you’ll find on almost every website. Which is an input field with no visual label at all. Just a placeholder and perhaps with an icon.\n\nI'll explain what's missing or what's flawed with the approaches you'll see on on most websites. As an example we’ll use a search field since it's quite common and it fits the UI pattern quite well.\n\n## The bare essentials and why it's flawed to begin with\n\nLet's dive into a basic search field example which represents this pattern. An input with no label.\n\n```html\n\u003cform role=\"search\"\u003e\n  \u003cinput type=\"search\" name=\"search\" placeholder=\"Find repositories..\"/\u003e\n\u003c/form\u003e\n```\n\n\u003e Perhaps you've noticed — or you already know this — that the input element has `search` as its type instead of `text`, and you might expect the latter. The difference of using `search` over `text` is that the user is able to reset the search query through the **Esc** key and it’s announced as a search\n\nSo our search field has a `placeholder` with **”Find repositories..“**.  It doesn't have a `label` associated with the input field, because why should we have one if it's visually not there. Right?\n\n## What’s so flawed about it?\n\nYou might wonder what the problems are with the example above? Well, in this example there’s two problems I’ll cover.\n\n1. The `placeholder` is used as a substitute for the `label`.\n2. People who use Voice Control, or something similiar, aren’t able to interact directly with the search field.\n\n### Placeholder shenanigans\n\nWhen you do a search for **placeholder** combined with **accessibility**, you'll see a lot of articles on why you shouldn't use placeholders to begin with. This is because the `placeholder` attribute is tied to a lot of accessible problems. I’ll cover those problems on a different time because it’s beyond the scope of this post.\n\nThe main takeaway I want to share about the `placeholder` attribute is that we shouldn’t depend on it. The intent of a `placeholder` isn’t the same as the intent of a `label`. And this is important for assistive technologies, like screen readers. To give you an example. In 2019 JAWS, one the biggest screen readers,[^1] changed how they processed the `placeholder` attribute. Before this change the `placeholder` attribute was completely ignored.\n\n### Voice Control can’t be fully utilised\n\nThe second problem is that assistive technology like Voice Control can’t interact with the search field directly. What do I mean by that? Well, it's not possible to use the command **“Click search”**. This command in Voice Control lets you select any interactible element based on the name of the `label`. Considering that we don't have a label (yet), we're not able to use this command.\n\n## So how could we solve this?\n\nWe have a couple of options at our disposal:\n\n1. The first option is to add an explicit `label`. If you want to read more on what an explicit `label` is and how we could add them: [The what, why and how on labels](https://www.beingfrankly.nl/blog/the-what-why-and-how-behind-labels).  The twist in this situation, however, is that we’ll hide the label visually through CSS.\n2. As a second option we could use the  `aria-label` attribute. This doesn’t require any CSS magic to hide it since the `aria-label` attribute isn’t visually shown.\n\n### First option: the invisible label\n\nThe first step is through adding an explicit `label` for our search field:\n\n```html\n\u003cform role=\"search\"\u003e\n  \u003clabel for=\"search-input\" class=\"sr-only\"\u003eFind repositories..\u003c/label\u003e\n  \u003cinput id=\"search-input\" type=\"search\" name=\"search\" placeholder=\"Find repositories..\"/\u003e\n\u003c/form\u003e\n```\n\n\u003e **Note:** If a placeholder is present with a label, make sure that the values match exactly. Yes, including the dots. Otherwise the screen reader — in this case Voice Over on MacOS — will announce the value of the `label` followed by the value of the `placeholder`.\n\nWe’re not done of course, since we now have a `label` that’s still visible. And the requirement from the design (or from somewhere else) was quite clear. We shouldn’t have a visible `label`. So the next step is to perform some CSS magic which will turn our `label` invisible.\n\nYou might have spotted the `sr-only` class on the `label`. The following snippet is the CSS magic that will turn our `label` invisible.\n\n```css\n.sr-only {\n\tclip: rect(0 0 0 0);\n\tclip-path: inset(50%);\n\theight: 1px;\n\toverflow: hidden;\n\tposition: absolute;\n\twhite-space: nowrap;\n\twidth: 1px;\n}\n```\n\n\u003e Credit for this CSS snippet goes to Scott O'Hara [^2]\n\nEven though it’s visually not there, the `label` still remains visible in the `Accessible tree`[^3] which is exactly what we need to make our search field accessible.\n\n### Second option: the other invisible label, aria-label\n\nIf, for whatever reason, it’s not possible to add an explicit `label` then we’ll turn to the second option. The `aria-label` attribute. It has the same semantic meaning as the `label`, so it’s doing a lot better than the `placeholder` attribute. And this is because the `aria-label` tries to act like the native `label` element. Let’s add it to our search field.\n\n```html\n\u003cform role=\"search\"\u003e\n  \u003cinput aria-label=\"Find repositories...\" type=\"search\" name=\"search\" placeholder=\"Find repositories..\"/\u003e\n\u003c/form\u003e\n```\n\nBecause `aria-label` is just an attribute and not a HTML element, we don’t need to do any CSS magic to turn it invisible.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSo this is it. We’ve explored two options to make our search field more accessible. The explicit `label` and the `aria-label` attribute. A short recap.\n\n- We shouldn’t use the `placeholder` attribute as a substitute for a `label`\n- A label is required if we want to use Voice Control’s command **“Click”**\n- When a HTML element is visually not shown it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s gone from the Accessibility Tree\n- Don’t forget to match the text from a `label` with the `placeholder`. Unless you want the screen reader to announce it twice!\n- If it’s not possible to add an explicit `label` we should use the `aria-label` attribute\n[^3]:[Read more - MDN on Accessibility tree](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Accessibility_tree)\n\n[^1]: [Read more - Screen reader usage share]( https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey9/#primary)\n[^2]: [Read more - Visually hidden CSS snippet](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2017/04/14/inclusively-hidden.html)\n","postPath":"How to have an accessible input while the label is invisible.md","title":"How to have an accessible input while the label is invisible"},{"data":{"type":"blog","title":"The what, why and how behind labels","published":true,"published_on":"2021-06-09","tags":["accessibility","labels"],"description":"As this is an introduction","keywords":["accessibility","labels","explicit","implicit","input"],"slug":"what-why-and-how-on-labels","id":"2021w23b1","updatedOn":"2021-10-21T10:29:17.036Z"},"content":"\n# The what, why and how on labels\n\nToday I want to take the chance to tell you about the importance of labels and what they have to offer us. So with this bite-sized post I’ll cover the following: what a label is, what a label does if you use them, how we can use/add labels and which other HTML elements should have a label.\n\n## So, what's a label to begin with?\n\nWell, the `\u003clabel\u003e` is a simple HTML element that holds a text value,[^1] which explains something about the related input element. And that's basically it for our humble label element. So how could such a simple HTML element have such an impact? Let's find out together.\n\n## Why should we use labels?\n\nWhy we need to use labels, is to understand what they’ll do for us when we use them. So, what do we gain when we use a label? Well, when we’ve paired a label to an input field it does two things:\n\n1. Increases the **interactive area** of the associated input field. The browser does this for us when it sees a label paired with an input field. But what does it mean when the interactive area is increased? Well when the user clicks on the label it will instead focus on the associated input field. This improves the UX on mobile devices and for users with a physical disability (e.g. tremors).\n\n2. Screen readers are able to announce the name (the associated label) of an input field when it's focused. See the examples down below what the difference is with and without an associated label.\n\n### Without label\n\n```html\n\u003cinput type=\"text\" name=\"username\" /\u003e\n```\n\n\u003e This will say: \"edit text blank\" on MacBook Voice Over\n\n### With label\n\n```html\n\u003clabel for=\"username_input\"\u003eUsername:\u003c/label\u003e\n\u003cinput id=\"username_input\" type=\"text\" name=\"username\"/\u003e\n```\n\n\u003e This will say: \"Username, edit text\" on MacBook Voice Over\n\n## How could we add a label?\n\nThere are two approaches for adding a label. The first approach is called **implicit** and the second approach is called **explicit**. We'll cover **implicit** first and then I'll continue with **explicit**. And I’ll explain why the second approach is the recommended option.\n\n### Implicit\n\nWith the implicit method we use the label as a **wrapper/container.** It doesn’t require anything else from us. Just put the input field inside and you’re done. You’ve added the label and associated it ***implicitly*** with an input field.\n\n```html\n\u003clabel\u003e\n\tEmail:\n\t\u003cinput type=\"text\" name=\"email\" /\u003e\n\u003c/label\u003e\n```\n\nLet’s move on to the second approach.\n\n### Explicit (recommended)\n\nWith the explicit approach we don’t use the label as a wrapper/container. And we're not required to put it directly before the input field in the DOM* to make it work (which you’ll see in every example, even the one down below). So how could we tell HTML that the label we’re using is for specific input field? Through two special attributes: `for` \u0026 `id`.\n\n```html\n\u003clabel for=\"email_input\"\u003eEmail:\u003c/label\u003e\n\u003cinput id=\"email_input\" type=\"text\" name=\"email\"/\u003e\n```\n\nThe label element has a `for` attribute that will have a certain value. The input element on their turn has an `id` attribute which also holds a certain value. You may have guessed it, without peeking at the example above, that both attributes need to have the same value. By using the same value in the `for` and the `id` attribute you'll ***explicitly*** associate the label to an input field.\n\nSo why is this the recommended approach? To put it simply, because of accessibility support.[^2] At the moment it's not possible to select an input by its name (the associated label) through voice command (e.g. Voice Control from Apple). I've tested this myself on a MacBook with Safari and Voice Control. And it just didn't work, no matter how many times I've tried. I'll add a link down below for the current support results\n\nNow we know how to use and associate a label with an input. But are we limited to just an input or are there more potential friends for our label? There sure are and they're grouped together under \"labelable\" fields.\n\n## Labelable, excuse me?\n\nAs a non English speaker, that word is just a mouthful for me. Moving on. So this term groups a list of elements together that should be paired with a label.[^3] I won't go into it further details what each element does on its own.\n\nLabelable fields:\n\n- button\n- inputs\n- meter\n- output\n- progress\n- select\n- textarea\n\nThe odd one in the list above is the `button` element. Even though it's considered a labelable element it should **not** be paired with a label. This is because the button already comes with a label, which is the text value inside the tags.[^4] When using `\u003cinput type=\"button\" value=\"Sign up\"/\u003e` the label comes from it's `value` attribute.\n\n \u003e Credit goes to [InHuOfficial](https://dev.to/inhuofficial) for pointing out that I've missed this in the original post.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- When labels are used screen readers are able to do their work and assist their users\n- Labels increase the interactive area for input fields which improves the user experience\n- Using labels *explicitly* is the recommended option when pairing up with a labelable element\n- Labels used implicitly lack support for voice commands\n\nIn the next bite-sized blog we’re going to learn what to do when we can’t show a label visually. For whatever reason that might be.\n\n### References\n\n[^1]: [Read more - MDN Label documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label)\n[^2]: [Read more  - Lacking support for **implicit** labels](https://a11ysupport.io/tests/html_label_element_implicit#support-summary-by-at-sr)\n[^3]: [Read more - HTML labelable elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#category-label)\n[^4]: [Read more - Labeling buttons](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/labels/#labeling-buttons)\n","postPath":"The what, why and how behind labels.md","title":"The what, why and how behind labels"}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/blog","query":{},"buildId":"pZmcGkdlqBtF-jqIycwn4","isFallback":false,"gsp":true}</script><script nomodule="" src="/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-8f31809deb7932dd0187.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-50bee04d1dc61f8adf5b.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/framework.e3de07479da4f2477dea.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/99f422a92ff7083adb8a7d840734144fa7589f68.bce02e69312252b55667.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/main-ad348870379541fa1635.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-68db19c153083c5b82c2.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/blog-c1425338cf13bb58c9a9.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/pZmcGkdlqBtF-jqIycwn4/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/pZmcGkdlqBtF-jqIycwn4/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
