I\\u2019ll be honest here and say that I found this rather confusing in the beginning. Only after reading about it and understanding the intent behind the rule did it click with me. I think it might have been better to name the first rule like this: \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"Prefer native HTML over ARIA\"),\". We shouldn\\u2019t use ARIA attributes without considering using the semantic HTML element first.

It doesn't have some of the advantages that the \",mdx(\"inlineCode\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"<label>\"),\" element has, but its purpose is the same.

It could look like this:\"),mdx(\"pre\",null,mdx(\"code\",i({parentName:\"pre\"},{className:\"language-html\"}),`<button aria-label=\"Close\">\n  <svg>\n    <!-- svg content -->\n  </svg>\n</button>\n`)),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The \",mdx(\"inlineCode\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"aria-label\"),\" attribute takes a string value, which is then used to create the Accessible Name for the \",mdx(\"inlineCode\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"<button>\"),\" element. The common use case for the \",mdx(\"inlineCode\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"aria-label\"),\" attribute is when we\\u2019re not able to use the native \",mdx(\"inlineCode\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"<label>\"),\" element, while still providing context for the Accessible Name.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"The aria-labelledby\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Although the \",mdx(\"inlineCode\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"aria-labelledby\"),\" attribute may look similar to \",mdx(\"inlineCode\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"aria-label\"),\", it works quite different.
